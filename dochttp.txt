Steps to get started:

0. Use a clean/missing Data.fs

1. Create a manager with the name "mgr", password "mgrpw", and grant
   the zope.Manager role.

2. Install tcpwatch.

3. Create a temporary directory to record tcpwatch output.

4. Run tcpwatch using:
   tcpwatch.py -L 8081:8080 -s -r tmpdir
   (the ports are the listening port and forwarded-to port; the
   second need to match the Zope configuration)

5. In a browser, connect to the listening port and do whatever needs
   to be recorded.

6. Shut down tcpwatch.

7. Run the script src/zope/app/testing/dochttp.py:
   python2.3 src/zope/app/testing/dochttp.py tmpdir > somefile.txt

8. Edit the generated text file to add explanations and elide
   uninteresting portions of the output.

9. In a functional test module (usually ftests.py), import
   FunctionalDocFileSuite from zope.app.testing.functional and
   instantiate it, passing the name of the text file containing the
   test.
